## Datasheet for Customer Churn Prediction Model


   # 1. Motivation  
– Purpose  
  The dataset was released by IBM Sample Analytics to illustrate customer-churn modelling for subscription-based businesses. It is widely used for teaching, benchmarking classical ML pipelines, and rapid prototyping of binary-classification methods.  
– Supporting tasks  
  Primary: Predict whether a telco customer will churn in the next period (binary classification).  
  Secondary: Exploratory data analysis on usage patterns, survival/retention modelling, uplift modelling, cost-sensitive learning, explainability demos.  
– Creators & funders  
  • Original creator: IBM Sample Analytics Team (publicly posted on IBM Community & Kaggle).  
  • Funding: Internal IBM resources (no outside grant reported).  
– Beneficial uses  
  – Educational tutorials on feature engineering, class imbalance, model evaluation.  
  – Benchmarking lightweight tabular AutoML systems.  
  – Demonstrations of fairness/explainability tooling.  
– Misuse and out-of-scope uses  
  – Re-identification or linkage attacks on hypothetical individuals.  
  – Drawing real-world demographic conclusions (gender, senior-citizen) about actual telco populations—the data are synthetic/obfuscated.  
  – Deployment in production without extensive validation—field distributions may differ.  
   # 2. Composition  
– Instances  
  7 043 customer records, each representing a unique billing account at a given snapshot in time.  
– Features (21)  
  Numerical (2)  
   • tenure – number of months with the company (int)  
   • MonthlyCharges – current monthly fee (float)  
   • TotalCharges – life-time spend (float)  
  Categorical/Binary (18)  
   customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, Churn (target variable).
– Missing data  
  • 11 rows have blank “TotalCharges” where tenure = 0.  
– Sensitive attributes  
  • gender, age proxy (SeniorCitizen) could be used as sensitive or legally protected classes.  
– Class balance  
  • Churn = “Yes”: 26.5 % (1 869)  
  • Churn = “No”: 73.5 % (5 174)  
– Is the data synthetic?  
  Yes—values are simulated/perturbed; no personally identifiable information remains.  
   # 3. Collection process  
– Original raw source  
  Generated by IBM Analytics from an undisclosed U.S. telco-like schema; released via IBM community blog c. 2018.  

– Sampling strategy  
  • Undisclosed. Likely convenience sampling to match realistic churn rates.  
– Timeframe  
  • Snapshot; tenure indicates up to 72 months of history but no explicit date field.  
– Consent & Privacy  
  • Since data are synthetic, no direct consent needed.  
   # 4. Pre-processing / cleaning / labeling  
– Pre-processing done by original release  
  • Categorical values coerced to strings.  
  • SeniorCitizen stored as 0/1 ints (not booleans).  
  • customerID is a random hash.  
  • TotalCharges appears as a string; must be converted to float with coercion.  
– Your recommended additional steps  
  1. Strip whitespace and cast TotalCharges to numeric; drop 11 NA rows or impute 0.  
  2. Encode categoricals (one-hot or target encoding).  
  3. Check multicollinearity (TotalCharges highly correlated with tenure × MonthlyCharges).  
  4. Address class imbalance (e.g. stratified splits, weighting, SMOTE).  
  5. Consider fairness auditing for gender & SeniorCitizen.

   # 6. Uses  
– Training / Validation splits  
  • Typical 70 / 30 stratified or k-fold cross-validation.  
  • Time-based split impossible (no timestamp).  
– Performance metrics  
  • Accuracy, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, recall at fixed precision (because churn is minority).  
  • Financial cost metrics (e.g. expected monthly revenue saved).  
– Fairness & ethics testing  
  • Evaluate disparate impact across gender & SeniorCitizen.  
  • Check calibration curves per subgroup.  
   # 7. Maintenance  
– Owner of the canonical copy  
  • IBM Sample Analytics GitHub.  
– Updates  
  • No planned updates—static dataset.  
– Bug reporting  
  • Open an issue in the IBM sample-data repository 
   # 8. Ethical considerations & biases  
– Representational risks  
  • Gender variable only contains “Male” and “Female” → non-inclusive.  
  • SeniorCitizen is binary thresholded at 65 yrs (assumed); discards nuanced age info.  

– Statistical biases  
  • Synthetic generation may not reflect real churn drivers; models trained here risk poor external validity.  
– Societal & legal risks  
  • If deployed uncautiously, churn-prediction systems can be used for differential pricing that discriminates against protected groups.  
– Risk mitigation recommendations  
  – Document model purpose and protected-attribute impacts during evaluation.  
  – Apply fairness constraints or post-processing if deploying in sensitive domains.  
  – Communicate that the dataset is synthetic and not representative of any country’s demographics.
